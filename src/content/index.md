payment:
  - answer: >-
      All Documenters.org assignments are independent contracts based on a pay
      rate of $16 per hour, however some assignments also include a minimum base
      rate. Our most common assignments are taking notes or live-tweeting
      government open meetings.


      **Public meeting-related assignments:**


      * For meetings that run 2 hours or less, default pay per assignment is
      $56. This assumes a total of 3.5 hours: 2 hours for meeting attendance +
      1.5 hours for pre-research, follow-up work, note editing, uploading, etc.

      * If a meeting runs longer, we adjust your compensation to the meeting
      duration (rounded up to the nearest half hour) + 1.5 hours.

      * If your assigned meeting is cancelled less than 72 hours in advance of
      the scheduled start time, we will pay you a "kill fee" of $16.

      * City Bureau is not obligated to pay a kill fee if you are unable to
      attend an assigned meeting (i.e. due to transportation delays, unexpected
      illness, a family emergency). In such a situation, you may share any
      research you did in preparation for the assignment and we will consider
      compensation for your time.


      Please include the exact duration of your assigned meeting in your
      submission checklist (meeting duration is confirmed through meeting
      minutes, official confirmation and Documenter checklists).


      **Special Assignments:**


      Unless otherwise noted in the assignment details, Street Team assignments
      and Special Assignments are paid at $16 per hour rounded up to the nearest
      half-hour. View your assigned meeting on Documenters.org for details and
      contact our Documenters Field Coordinator for questions.


      **Transportation:**


      Legally, we cannot reimburse contractors for typical time or costs
      associated with getting to your assignment (i.e. gas, toll fees, transit
      fees). If you encounter extenuating circumstances on your commute (for
      example, a train line is shut down or a bus hasn’t come yet) let your
      Documenters Field Coordinator know right away. In most cases, we can
      suggest alternatives and provide support to get you there, including
      rideshare reimbursement.
    question: How does the Documenters.org pay scale work?
  - answer: >-
      All required content must be completed before an assignment is approved
      and payment is released. City Bureau reserves the right to cancel payment
      for late or incomplete submissions.


      After you are assigned to your first role you’ll receive an email from
      City Bureau’s operations team, as well as an invite to join Gusto, the
      system we use to manage payments. Click the link in the email to create a
      Gusto account and enter your Social Security number, address, and bank
      account coordinates (The information is kept securely by Gusto). Once that
      information is entered you’ll be set up for direct deposit, and you’ll
      also be able to login anytime to see your payment records or tax forms.


      We run payments for all approved assignments every Monday, and, provided
      you've set up your Gusto profile, the payment will be in your account 5
      days after we press the button. If there are no bank holidays, this is
      usually Friday. If you have any questions about payment contact your
      Documenters Field Coordinator.
