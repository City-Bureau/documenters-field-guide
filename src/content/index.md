      Our three most common assignments: 1) meeting notes + audio recording 2)
      live-tweeting + photos 3) special assignments.


      All Documenters.org assignments are independent contracts based on a pay
      rate of $16 per hour, however some assignments also include a minimum base
      rate.


      **Public meeting-related assignments:**

      - We pay $16 per hour.

      - For meetings that run 2 hours or less, default pay is 3.5 hours: 2 hours
      for meeting attendance + 1.5 hours for pre-research, follow-up work, note
      editing, uploading, etc.

      - If a meeting runs longer, we adjust your compensation to the meeting
      duration (rounded up to the nearest half hour) + 1.5 hours.

      - If your assigned meeting is cancelled less than 72 hours in advance of
      the scheduled start time, we pay a "kill fee" of $16.


      Please include the exact duration of your assigned meeting in your meeting
      checklist upon submission (meeting duration is confirmed through meeting
      minutes, official confirmation and Documenter checklists). All required
      content must be completed before an assignment is approved and payment is
      released.


      **Special Assignments:**


      Unless otherwise noted in the assignment details, Street Team assignments
      and Special Assignments are paid at $16 per hour rounded up to the nearest
      half-hour. View your assigned meeting on Documenters.org for details and
      contact our Documenters Field Coordinator for questions.
    question: How does the Documenters.org pay scale work?
  - answer: >
      After your first submission you’ll receive an email from Gusto, the system
      we use to manage payments. Click the link in the email to create your
      account and enter your social security number, address, and bank account
      coordinates (The information is kept securely by Gusto). Once that
      information is entered you’ll be set up for direct deposit, and you’ll
      also be able to login anytime to see your payment records or tax forms.


      We run payments for all approved assignments every Monday, and, provided
      you've set up your Gusto profile, the payment will be in your account 5
      days after we press the button. If there are no bank holidays, this is
      usually Friday. If you have any questions about payment contact your
      Documenters Field Coordinator.
