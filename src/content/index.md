      All Documenters.org assignments in Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Fresno and Omaha are independent contracts. Atlanta, Cleveland and Detroit assignments are based on a pay rate of $16 per hour. Omaha assignments are based on a pay rate of $15 per hour. Chicago Documenters assignments are  based on a pay rate of $18 per hour. Fresno Documenters assignments are based on a pay rate of $20 per hour. Minneapolis assignments are part-time work based on a pay rate of $20 per hour. Our most common assignments are taking notes or live-tweeting government open meetings. For special assignments, each posting will include estimated hours needed for completion.
      * In Atlanta, Cleveland and Detroit, for meetings that run 2 hours or less, default pay per assignment is $56. This assumes a total of 3.5 hours: 2 hours for meeting attendance + 1.5 hours for pre-research, follow-up work, note editing, uploading, etc. In Fresno and Minneapolis, for meetings that run 2 hours or less, default pay is $70: 2 hours for meeting attednance + 1.5 hours for pre-research, follow-up work, note editing, uploading, etc. In Omaha, for meetings that run 2 hours or less, default pay per assignment is $52.50. This assumes a total of 3.5 hours: 2 hours for meeting attendance + 1.5 hours for pre-research, follow-up work, note editing, uploading, etc. 
      * For Chicago public meeting-related assignments, your assignment hours include the total meeting duration and outside work.
      * “Total meeting duration” is the time between a meeting’s scheduled start time to the actual end time (when the meeting ends and/or you stop documenting it), including closed or executive session.
      * “Outside work” refers to the time you spend doing pre-meeting research and post-meeting revisions. 
      * For meetings where the “total meeting duration” is 4 hours or shorter, we’ll pay for two hours of “outside work.”
      * For meetings that run over 4 hours, we will pay for “outside work” hours that equal half of the meeting duration. (So if you cover a 5-hour meeting, we would compensate you for 2.5 hours of “outside work,” and for a 6-hour meeting, we would pay for 3 hours of “outside work.”
      * See the question below for a chart detailing the amount of pay based on the length of a meeting.
      * Each assignment will include information about whether it is happening in person, via a virtual platform or both (hybrid). In most cases, you will get to choose how you tune in to the meeting, but any meetings documented in person will include an extra hour ($18) of pay. If you expect to be late to the meeting due to public transit issues, let Documenters staff know right away. 
      * Live-tweeting and note-taking assignments are paid using the same pay scale. Though they are very different tasks, they are equally demanding in their own ways. Notes require more revision/editing and time. Live-tweeting is less time-consuming but requires additional technical skills, quick-thinking and accuracy in the moment.

      * If a meeting runs longer, we adjust your compensation to the meeting
      duration (rounded up to the nearest half hour) + 1.5 hours.

      * If your assigned meeting is cancelled less than 72 hours in advance of
      the scheduled start time, all sites will pay you a "kill fee" equivalent to 1 hour of their local pay scale.

      * City Bureau and Documenters affiliates are not obligated to pay a kill fee if you are unable to attend an assigned meeting (i.e. due to transportation delays, unexpected illness, a family emergency). If you are unable to attend an assigned meeting please reply to your assignment email as soon as possible to let us know; we’re usually able to find someone else to cover it if given a few days’ notice. You may share any research you did in preparation for the assignment and we will consider paying you the kill fee.


      Please include the exact duration of your assigned meeting in your
      submission checklist (meeting duration is confirmed through meeting
      minutes, official confirmation and Documenter checklists).


      **Special Assignments:**


      Unless otherwise noted in the assignment details, Street Team assignments
      and Special Assignments are paid at the local hourly rate mentioned above rounded up to the nearest
      half-hour. View your assigned meeting on Documenters.org for details and
      contact our Documenters Field Coordinator for questions.


      **Transportation:**


      Legally, we cannot reimburse contractors for typical time or costs
      associated with getting to your assignment (i.e. gas, toll fees, transit
      fees). If you encounter extenuating circumstances on your commute (for
      example, a train line is shut down or a bus hasn’t come yet) let your
      Documenters Field Coordinator know right away. In most cases, we can
      suggest alternatives and provide support to get you there, including
      rideshare reimbursement.
   question: How does the Documenters.org pay scale work?

  - answer: >-
      All required content must be completed before an assignment is approved
      and payment is released. City Bureau and o reserves the right to cancel payment
      for late or incomplete submissions.


      After you are assigned to your first role you’ll receive an email from
      City Bureau’s operations team, as well as an invite to join Gusto, the
      system we use to manage payments. Click the link in the email to create a
      Gusto account and enter your Social Security number, address, and bank
      account coordinates (The information is kept securely by Gusto). Once that
      information is entered you’ll be set up for direct deposit, and you’ll
      also be able to login anytime to see your payment records or tax forms.


      We run payments for all approved assignments every Monday, and, provided
      you've set up your Gusto profile, the payment will be in your account 5
      days after we press the button. If there are no bank holidays, this is
      usually Friday. If you have any questions about payment contact your
      Documenters Field Coordinator.
