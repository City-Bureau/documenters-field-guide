Once you're assigned to cover a meeting, be sure to study up before you attend. Many of these agencies are not well-known, so walking in prepared enables you to bridge that information gap. If an important issue will be discussed there you definitely want to know a bit about it in advance!

- Click on "View original meeting details" or "View website" on your assignment page to go to the agency website and learn more about what it does. Take a moment to write out a 1-3 sentence description of the agency in advance of the meeting, and you've already completed something that can turn into one of your tweets or notes entries.
- Confirm the meeting time and place. Committee meetings at City Hall are often shifted to a different room.
- Check for relevant previous Documenters content in the [Published view ](https://chicago.documenters.org/assignments/?alt=true)of the Assignments tab.
- See our [Web Research](https://fieldguide.documenters.org/on-assignment/web-research/) tab for more tips and resources for finding reliable websites and sources that you can post during live-tweeting assignments or hyperlink in your meeting notes.
