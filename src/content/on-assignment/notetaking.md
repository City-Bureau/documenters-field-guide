> ### Good notetaking is the _most essential skill_ for good documentation.
>
> We’ve listed some best practices below but the truth is, the best notes are the notes that help you record accurate information.

## What to Pack

- ![Pen icon](/img/ic-notes.svg) Something to take notes—whatever you are most comfortable using

## Assignment Requirements

- Your meeting notes should be 1-3 pages in length, single-spaced, and submitted via the Google Doc attached to your assignment. The correct Google Doc is shared to your email address each time you are assigned to document a meeting. See **Sample Meeting Notes Template** and **Example Meeting Notes** below for what to expect.
- Include 8-10 hyperlinks throughout the text of your notes (a hyperlink is a link in your text that connects readers with an external website).
- Submit your notes within 24 hours after the meeting ends.

## Tips

1. **Do your pre-research:** Prepare for your assignment by reading any meeting minutes, agendas, transcripts and other documentation associated with your meeting.
2. **Create a system:** It’s ok to stick to keywords, phrases and short sentences to maximize the number of points you record during you assigned meeting (you can always add later). Raw notes can be used to create a more thorough submission.
3. **Listen and learn:** Make a conscious effort to pay attention during your assignment. Concentrate on being accurate and hearing different perspectives.
4. **Make connections:** Notetaking by hand? Weave blank space throughout your notes to backfill with comments, questions and connections that arise throughout meeting. Typing? Use functions like bold and underlined text to group similar sections.
5. **Review and edit:** Following the meeting, make sure your writing is legible, any scribbles are clarified and all your “i”s are dotted following the meeting. But don’t wait too long between writing and review. Useful details may fade from your memory over time.
6. **Use your time efficiently:** Our default pay rate is 3.5 hours for meetings that run under 2 hours. We expect reasonably concise and thorough notes in line with that time allotment.
