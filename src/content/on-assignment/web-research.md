> Accurate news articles, academic research, meeting agendas and related governmental websites can add context and background to your documentation.

Here are some avenues for further exploration:

## The Basics

Start with an online search of keywords related to the department holding your meeting. Timely news articles about City Council can be searched with the appropriate search terms, for example, "Detroit City Council" AND the names of specific council members, i.e. "Councilman James Smith" OR a combination of topics related to your interest, i.e. "Alderman Joe Moore Chicago City Council participatory budgeting".

Seek out primary sources and trusted news outlets for the most up-to-date and accurate information.

## Research and Resource Tips

1. Find your municipality’s official website
2. Use quote marks (“ “) to locate a specific phrase verbatim (i.e. “Mark Murray” voting history)
3. Use the minus sign (-) to remove results from your search (i.e. “Philadelphia crime -violence”)
4. Use CTRL +F to find a specific word or phrase on a webpage
5. Use “wildcard search” characters like asterisks (\*) and question marks (?) to widen your searches (i.e. search results for “educat\*” will include educate, educated, education, educational or educator)
6. Use multiple search engines
7. Review quality news content related to your topic (quality news outlets will have a track record of excellence, and a quality story will often feature a byline, links to source materials, multiple sources and good spelling/grammar)
8. Taking notes? Copy/paste or hyperlink relevant webpages for reference

## Chicago

[Chicago Legistar](https://chicago.legistar.com/)

* Management system used by the City Clerk to post information about City Council members, committees, meetings and legislation status.
* Tip: Information on Legistar may appear on the website or in a PDF format. These versions are not necessarily exactly the same so it’s worth looking over both.
* Tip: if a meeting is scheduled but the agenda has not been posted yet, you can get a sense of what’s in the pipeline in the “Legislation” tab.
  * “Current Controlling Legislative Body”: select the committee from the drop-down list
  * “Status”: to see most of the relevant legislation, select “Introduced” (“Placed on File,” “Direct Introduction,” or “Re-referred” may also yield some results)
  * Hit “Search Legislation.” It may take a few seconds to load.
