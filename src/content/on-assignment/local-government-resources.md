## Chicago

[Chicago Legistar](https://chicago.legistar.com/)

* Management system used by the City Clerk to post information about City Council members, committees, meetings and legislation status.
* Tip: Information on Legistar may appear on the website or in a PDF format. These versions are not necessarily exactly the same so it’s worth looking over both.
* Tip: if a meeting is scheduled but the agenda has not been posted yet, you can get a sense of what’s in the pipeline in the “Legislation” tab.
  * “Current Controlling Legislative Body”: select the committee from the drop-down list
  * “Status”: to see most of the relevant legislation, select “Introduced” (“Placed on File,” “Direct Introduction,” or “Re-referred” may also yield some results)
  * Hit “Search Legislation.” It may take a few seconds to load.
